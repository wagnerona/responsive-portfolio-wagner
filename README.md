Week 2 challenge to create portfolio

## Welcome to my responsive portfolio!

I am currently enrolled in a front-end web development bootcamp, and as part of the program, I am creating this portfolio to showcase my skills and projects.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my ability to create responsive, mobile-friendly layouts using HTML, CSS, and possibly some JavaScript. I want to ensure that my portfolio looks great and is easy to use on a variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers.

To achieve this goal, I will be using media queries and other techniques to create a flexible, grid-based layout that adjusts to the size and orientation of the viewport. I will also be using responsive images and other optimization techniques to ensure that my portfolio loads quickly and smoothly on all devices.

I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio! If you have any feedback or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact me.
